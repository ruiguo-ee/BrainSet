-) The dataset is constructed for electromagnetic brain imaging.
   Six parts: skull, gray matter, white matter and skin, skin and other tissues, CSF, other tissues and background, and strokes.
-) dataset300: each 3D model has a resolution of 1mm * 1mm * 1mm. 
   dataset100: each 3D model has a resolution of 3mm * 3mm * 3mm (Down-sampled from dataset300).
-) Each .mat file can be opened with MATLAB or Python.
